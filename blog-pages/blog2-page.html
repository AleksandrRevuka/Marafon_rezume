                        Icons are a crucial part of any design system or product
                        experience. Icons help us quickly navigate. They are
                        language-independent. And best of all: they're real tiny, so they
                        don't take up very much real estate. Icons are a fundamental part
                        of a good design system and are very helpful for marketing
                        materials. They’re the foundational building block of illustrated
                        content, but they are also highly technical.

                        There aren't many people who love to design icons, and even fewer
                        who are great at it. I wrote this guide to help you become one of
                        those people.

                        Whether you are a design systems expert, an illustrator, or a
                        product designer, this guide will help you learn how to build
                        icons, how to align them with your brand, and how to implement
                        them into your design system. Let's start with the basics.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Basic elements of an icon</h2>
                    <h2>Size</h2>
                    <p>
                        Consistency is key with icons, and all your icons should be the
                        same size when you build them. First, you'll need to make sure
                        that you know how your grid is built (multiple of 8 or 10?). From
                        there, your base icon size should relate directly to that. So, if
                        you have a grid based on 8s, you'd want to build at 16, 24, or 32.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Choose a common size to build all your icons to, and then allow
                        your engineers to scale to other sizes that might be needed by
                        other designers. You don't want to build the same icon over and
                        over at a multitude of sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you need glyph complexity, that's when you want to start
                        adding sizes. You might have your base product icon at 24px, but
                        marketing icons at 80px because of the vast difference in use.
                        You'll want to add detail for those larger sizes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When building the same icon at different sizes, I like to start
                        with the largest size and go down. I find it much easier to remove
                        details and simplify, rather than adding as I go up. It also gives
                        you a sense of the object before you truly minimize it.
