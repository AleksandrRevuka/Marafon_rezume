                    <p>
                        Moving into a new home can be one of life’s great joys, but it can
                        also be a time of uncertainty, especially when it comes to
                        decorating. How do you make your space look its best while
                        reflecting your personal sense of style? Do it well and you’ll end
                        up with a comfortable, happy home. Do it poorly and you’ll end up
                        with a hodge-podge of furniture, fabrics and paint colors that
                        never congeal into a pleasing whole. With a little planning, and
                        by following the same steps used by professional interior
                        designers, you’ll have a much greater chance of success.

                        To reach the finish line, you first have to know where you’re
                        going.

                        <strong>Don't Start in the Furniture Store</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many have heard the advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re
                        hungry, because it leads to poor choices. The same holds true for
                        furniture stores – don’t go shopping in a panic, just because you
                        have an empty home. Yes, you need a sofa. But if you pick the
                        pink-striped sectional just because you like it in the store,
                        without taking measurements or thinking about the rest of the
                        room, you’re stuck with it. The rest of the room will have to be
                        built around that sofa, and if it’s too large for the space it
                        will look forever awkward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Start in the room you’re looking to furnish, armed with a
                        measuring tape and a notepad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Know Your Measurements</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matching the scale of furniture to the scale of a room is
                        critical. A deep sectional sofa can easily overpower a small room
                        and svelte chairs can get lost in a wide-open loft. Before you
                        start designing, measure the length and width of each room you
                        intend to decorate, along with the ceiling height and elements
                        that could get in the way – stairs, columns, radiators and other
                        obstructions. It’s also a good idea to measure window openings,
                        along with the wall space below, above and to the sides of each
                        one, to get ready for window coverings.

                        “The first mistake most people make is that they buy things that
                        are the wrong size – sofas that don't fit in the room, sofas that
                        don't fit through doorways, tables that are too small, desks that
                        are too big, nightstands that hang into the doorway,” said David
                        Kleinberg, founder of the New York interior design firm David
                        Kleinberg Design Associates. Carefully measuring your space can
                        help avoid such problems.
