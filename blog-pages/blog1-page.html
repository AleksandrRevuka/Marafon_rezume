                    <h3>Making a design system from scratch</h3>

                        As someone who's always been striving for consistency, building
                        delightful and accessible experiences, and trying to do all that
                        faster than ever, the concept of âœ¨design systemsâœ¨ has always
                        interested me. I believe in setting up clear standards for colors
                        and fonts and establishing patterns to build reusable components
                        as the key to building sustainable UIs that can withstand the test
                        of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past few years, I've been working a lot on this blog, the
                        interactive experiences showcased in my blog posts, and several
                        other tiny projects that needed consistency in branding and
                        components. The more I worked on them, the more I felt the need to
                        stop copy-pasting code and colors between projects and needed my
                        own set of UI pieces: my personal design system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After pouring countless hours into this project and sharing my
                        progress over the past several months (almost a year now
                        actually!), I felt it was time to write a little return on
                        experience to focus on all the things I've learned while building
                        a design system on my own ðŸ˜Š. So in this blog post, I'll go
                        through the component patterns I came up with, explain how I
                        picked up my tokens and overall the design system thinking
                        mentality I adopted to make this project (somewhat) successful.

                    <h2>
                        Context: Why would I even choose to build my own design system?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Before jumping on the actual building part of this blog post, I
                        first want to give a bit more context on why I chose to dedicate
                        time to this project. Among the many reasons why this project came
                        to life, you will mainly find:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Branding:</strong>
                                I'm trying very hard to be unique in an endless sea of
                                developers' blogs/websites looking more or less the same. I
                                want people to recognize my work from afar through my choice
                                of colors, logo, components design, playfulness, and attention
                                to detail.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Consistency:</strong>
                                Each piece composing this system should have a purpose. All
                                components follow the same guidelines and are composed of more
                                primitive elements/tokens.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Fun and Learning:</strong>
                                I learned a lot about component building, design system
                                thinking, and myself while building this tiny library. It
                                helped me develop some empathy and step back and think twice
                                about the interface of a component, composability,
                                abstraction, and scalability. Focusing on one piece of the
                                system at a time and making that one component mine was tons
                                of fun and very satisfying.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This project was not a necessity per se, but the more my
                        blog/portfolio and brand were evolving, the more I was striving
                        for these things, and the more not having a design system was
                        slowing me down. I needed my own set of "Lego pieces" that I could
                        rearrange/combine infinitely. Thus the idea of building a personal
                        design system came to my mind:
                        <strong>
                            A small scoped design system mainly composed of primitive
                            components focused solely on personal branding and personal use.
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even though the scope of this design system feels small compared to the bigger ones we can get to work on in a work context, it was not necessarily less complex to build. In the following parts, I'll go through the challenges and decisions I've made along the way when working on this project.
