                        As someone who's always been striving for consistency, building delightful and accessible experiences, and trying to do all that faster than ever, the concept of ✨design systems✨ has always interested me. I believe in setting up clear standards for colors and fonts and establishing patterns to build reusable components as the key to building sustainable UIs that can withstand the test of time.

                        Icons are a crucial part of any design system or product experience. Icons help us quickly navigate. They are language-independent. And best of all: they're real tiny, so they don't take up very much real estate. Icons are a fundamental part of a good design system and are very helpful for marketing materials. They’re the foundational building block of illustrated content, but they are also highly technical.

                        Moving into a new home can be one of life’s great joys, but it can also be a time of uncertainty, especially when it comes to decorating. How do you make your space look its best while reflecting your personal sense of style? Do it well and you’ll end up with a comfortable, happy home. Do it poorly and you’ll end up with a hodge-podge of furniture, fabrics and paint colors that never congeal into a pleasing whole. With a little planning, and by following the same steps used by professional interior designers, you’ll have a much greater chance of success.
